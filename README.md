# Embedded-Programming
A repository to a project of Embedded Programming course with the implementation of a Steering Wheel.

The proposed project has the aim to develop, using a MCU like ATmega328p, a steering wheel with pedals programmed by C and using in all methods and actions interrupts, without any polling mode in order to preserve energy cosumption by the device used.

The comunication between the prototype and the PC is performed by bluetooth serial with HC-05 module and a python script that reads the values produced by the prototype and maps them to a virtual Joystick vJoy.
